                  <p>Over the past few weeks, states with already restrictive abortion laws have exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to further limit or outright ban abortion care in their states. Under the guise of protecting public health and prioritizing necessary medical resources and personnel to fight the pandemic, state governors, attorneys general, and state departments of health have issued orders that label abortion care as an elective and non-essential service. Most of these orders were met with resistance, and successfully overturned in court. Although these battles in states like Texas, Tennessee, Alabama, Iowa, Louisiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and Arkansas have been well documented, determining whether abortion is now available let alone accessible in these states and others remains obscure. </p>
                  <p>We believe that abortion care and reproductive health services more broadly are essential services. Furthermore, we believe that it is a person’s right to know whether abortion services are available in their state and if they can access these services safely. This website hopes to provide clear and up-to-date information regarding abortion access within one’s state during the COVID-19 pandemic. <strong>We have produced three maps that together indicate whether abortion services were initially defined as essential or non-essential services, whether abortion services are now available, and if so the the impact of pre-existing abortion restrictions on access to these services during the pandemic. </strong> Although many states across the US have started to open up, we still believe that continuous tracking of abortion availability and access is essential due to concerns and uncertainty around the threat of another wave of the virus, and the potential for renewed partial or full lockdown orders. </p>

                  <p>The COVID-19 Abortion Restriction Score is a composite score indicating the number of medically unnecessary and restrictive laws enacted in each state. The impacts of these restrictions on access to abortion services are amplified in the context of the pandemic. The laws that we chose to include were those identified in the Center for Reproductive Right’s <a target="_blank" href="http://reproductiverights.org/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19%20Underscores%20the%20Nonessential%20Nature%20of%20Abortion%20Restrictions.pdf">article</a> titled “COVID-19 Underscores the Nonessential Nature of Abortion Restrictions.” Each restrictive law included in the composite score is described below:</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li><strong>Two trip requirement for an abortion.</strong> <p>Some states require a women to attend the abortion clinic twice – once for counselling and in some cases tests or ultrasounds, and another for the procedure itself.  This increases a woman's risk of contracting and spreading the virus. Furthermore, the arrangements necessary to attend an two appointments in-person, place an increased burden on a women seeking abortion services in pandemic conditions (e.g. restrictions on travel, difficulty arranging and affording childcare, a place to stay, fear of placing family at risk of contracting COVID-19, etc.).</p><p>A state received a score of 3 if they require two trips for an abortion and a score of 0 if they do not have this requirement. Data for this restriction was acquired from the Guttmacher Institute’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/counseling-and-waiting-periods-abortion">data</a> on Counseling and Waiting Periods for Abortion.</p></li>
                  <li><strong>Telemedicine ban for abortion.</strong> <p>When telemedicine is banned, women are unable to access abortion care from home and are required to come to the clinic in person. This increases the risk of contracting and spreading the virus. The arrangements necessary to attend an appointment in-person, place an increased burden on a women seeking abortion services in pandemic conditions (e.g. restrictions on travel, difficulty arranging and affording childcare, a place to stay, fear of placing family at risk of contracting COVID-19, etc.).</p><p> A state received a score of 3 if telemedicine banned for abortion and a score of 0 if telemedicine is legal. Data for this restriction was acquired from the Guttmacher Institute’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/article_files/hostile_and_supportive_state_abortion_laws_1-24-2020.pdf">Hostilility Index for Abortion</a>.</p></li>
                  <li><strong>Restrictions limiting ability of providers to delegate tasks.</strong> <p>Some states require that the attending physician be present and administer the entirety of a patient’s care cycle, including counseling appointments. This diverts essential capacity that could be directed towards the care of other patients to the delivery of medically unnecessary consultations. This further diminishes already reduced clinic capacity brought about by COVID-19 policy changes. </p><p>A state received a score of 3 if counselling and state mandated counselling has to be provided by the attending or referring physician. A state received a score of 2 if the counselling had to be done by an attending or referring physician but state mandated counselling can be done by any health professional or online. A state received a score of 1 if counselling and state mandated counselling can be done by any health professional. Finally a state received a score of 0 if no biased counselling is required. Data for this restriction was collected from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/laws-policy/state-government/">NARAL Pro Choice</a>.</p></li>
                  <li><strong>Medication abortions must be administered in presence of the physician.</strong><p> Some states require that medication abortions must be administered under the supervision of the attending physician. This requirement prevents a prevents a women’s ability to access abortion care from home and instead requires her to come to the clinic in person, which increases her risk of contracting and spreading the virus. Furthermore, this law diverts essential physician capacity away from the care of other patients. </p><p> A state received a score of 3 if medication abortions must be administered in the presence of a physician and a score of 0 if this is not required. Data for this restriction was acquired from the Guttmacher Institute’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion">data on Medication Abortion</a>.</p></li>
                  </ol>                 
                   <p>To calculate the composite COVID-19 Abortion Restriction Score, we first weighted the values for the variable assessing the restrictions limiting providers to delegate tasks and the requirement of a physician to be present for the administration of medication abortion by 0.5. We decided to weight these values as we believe that the other two variables have a more significant impact on a women’s ability to access care during a pandemic, while the provider restrictions have more of an impact on facility capacity to provide services. We then added the weighted values of the restrictions for each state. Abortion services are more difficult to access in states with higher COVID-19 restriction scores than in states with lower scores. Through this map we hope to demonstrate that the availability of abortion services and their designation as essential or non-essential, is insufficient to understanding access to abortion services during COVID-19. The effects of laws that were set in place to restrict abortion access and service provision before the pandemic are amplified in pandemic conditions. It is critical to acknowledge the additional barriers and burden that these laws impose on both people seeking healthcare services and abortion service providers in order to develop an accurate understanding of access to abortion services in the U.S. during COVID-19.</p>

                  <p>The data for this map was collected using state government executive orders, press releases, and other news articles and analysis tracking whether abortion services were considered essential services during COVID-19. We classified each state into the following four categories according to the language used in their initial government order or official statement to the press in which essential and non-essential services were designated.</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li>Explicitly defines abortion care as non-essential</li>
                  <li>Does not explicitly define abortion care as essential or non-essential but leaves decision up to the medical provider</li>
                  <li>Does not explicitly define abortion care as essential or non-essential</li>
                  <li>Explicitly defines abortion care as an essential service</li>  </ol>                
                  <p>Through this map, we hope to demonstrate the necessity for explicit language indicating that abortion care is an essential service. Any ambiguity around this definition can be used by anti-abortion activists and government officials alike to restrict abortion access during the pandemic. We recorded each state’s designation in their initial government order, regardless of whether amendments to this designation were made. Initial designation highlights the level of priority given to reproductive health services and rights. </p>

                  <p>The data for this map was collected using news articles tracking the availability of abortion services across the US, abortion clinic websites, and abortion access funds and network pages. According to this data we classified each state into the following four categories:</p>

                  <li>Abortion care (surgical and medication) is currently unavailable or banned</li>

                  <p>For some states, no reliable data was found regarding the availability of abortion services. To mitigate the risk of providing misinformation, these states were classified as having no data. Through this map we hope to provide up-to-date information regarding the availability of abortion across the US. In addition to this, we hope to draw attention to states where, although abortion might currently be available, access to care is under threat. </p>

Since then the state issued a replacement order encouraging residents to stay home and continued to ban non-work gatherings of over 10 people.

          <p>Despite plans to start reopening salons and other services in the state on May 6, the state issued an <a target="_blank" href=" https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/images/uploads/pdf/ResumeElectiveSurgeryDirectiveFINAL4.23.20.pdf">order </a> on May 5, stating that those seeking elective surgeries must have at least one negative COVID-19 NAAT test within 48 hours prior to the beginning of the procedure. On May 7, a federal judge <a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/ffff1417b388d59c41380629c554c9e2"> denied the request</a> from the only clinic able to provide abortions to block this testing rule.

Jared Polis (D)). Although the governor does not explicitly reference abortion care in his statement, the state’s attorney general provided a <a target="_blank" href="https://dems.ag/daga-dem-ags-statements-on-protecting-repro-health-care-during-covid-19/">statement</a> included in a press release from the Democratic Attorney General Association assuring that access to abortion care would be protected during the pandemic.</p>
          <p>On April 24, Governor Jared Polis announced a lifting of Colorado's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">stay at home order</a> instituting a “safer at home approach”. This enables the lifting of restrictions on retail business and since May 1 personal care businesses.</p>
