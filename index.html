                <p>Over the past few weeks, states with already restrictive abortion laws have exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to further limit or outright ban abortion care. Under the guise of protecting public health and reserving medical resources and personnel for the pandemic, state governors, attorneys general, and state departments of health have issued orders that label abortion care as elective and non-essential. Some high profile battles over reproductive rights are well documented, but abortion availability remains unclear in most parts of the country. </p>
                <p>We believe that all forms of reproductive healthcare are essential. We also believe that it is a person’s right to know whether abortion services are available and safely accessible in their state. This website aims to provide clear and up-to-date information regarding abortion access during the COVID-19 pandemic. <strong>We have produced three maps that illustrate the impact of restrictive abortion laws since the outbreak (1), the initial definition of abortion services as essential or non-essential in executive orders and early statements (2), and the current status of abortion availability (3).</strong> Although many states have started to reopen, we believe that continuous tracking of abortion availability and accessibility is vital. </p>

                  <p>The COVID-19 Abortion Restriction Score is a composite score indicating the number of medically unnecessary restrictive laws enacted in each state. The effects of these restrictions on access to abortion care are amplified in the context of the pandemic. A Center for Reproductive Rights <a target="_blank" href="http://reproductiverights.org/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19%20Underscores%20the%20Nonessential%20Nature%20of%20Abortion%20Restrictions.pdf">article</a> provides an extensive list of these laws and their potential impacts. We isolated the four restrictive laws that most affected abortion access during the COVID-19 pandemic and combined them to form the composite score. Those include:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                  <li><strong>Two trip requirement for an abortion.</strong> <p>Some states require a person to travel to the abortion clinic twice – once for counselling and in some cases tests or ultrasounds, and another for the procedure itself. This increases a person's risk of contracting and spreading the virus. Furthermore, the arrangements necessary to attend two in-person appointments, place an increased burden on a person seeking abortion services in pandemic conditions (e.g. restrictions on travel, difficulty arranging and affording childcare, a place to stay, fear of placing family at risk of contracting COVID-19, etc.).</p><p>A state received a score of 3 if they require two trips for an abortion and a score of 0 if they do not have this requirement. Data for this restriction were acquired from the Guttmacher Institute’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/counseling-and-waiting-periods-abortion">data</a> on Counseling and Waiting Periods for Abortion.</p></li>
                  <li><strong>Telemedicine ban for abortion.</strong> <p>When telemedicine is banned, people are unable to access abortion services from home and are required to come to the clinic in person. This increases the risk of contracting and spreading the virus. The arrangements necessary to attend an in-person appointment place an increased burden on a person seeking abortion services in pandemic conditions (e.g. restrictions on travel, difficulty arranging and affording childcare, a place to stay, fear of placing family at risk of contracting COVID-19, etc.).</p><p> A state received a score of 3 if telemedicine banned for abortion and a score of 0 if telemedicine is legal. Data for this restriction were acquired from the Guttmacher Institute’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/article_files/hostile_and_supportive_state_abortion_laws_1-24-2020.pdf">Hostilility Index for Abortion</a>.</p></li>
                  <li><strong>Restrictions limiting ability of providers to delegate tasks.</strong> <p>Some states require that the attending physician be present throughout the entirety of a patient’s care cycle, including counseling appointments. This diverts essential capacity that could be directed towards the care of other patients to the delivery of medically unnecessary consultations. This further diminishes already reduced clinic capacity brought about by COVID-19 policy changes.</p><p>A state received a score of 3 if counselling and state mandated counselling has to be provided by the attending or referring physician. A state received a score of 2 if counselling has to be done by an attending or referring physician but state mandated counselling can be done by any health professional or online. A state received a score of 1 if counselling and state mandated counselling can be done by any health professional. Finally a state received a score of 0 if no biased counselling is required. Data for this restriction were collected from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/laws-policy/state-government/">NARAL Pro Choice</a>.</p></li>
                  <li><strong>Medication abortions must be administered in the presence of a physician.</strong><p> Some states require that medication abortions be administered under the supervision of the attending physician. This requirement prevents a person from accessing abortion services from home and instead requires her to come to the clinic in person. This increases her risk of contracting and spreading the virus. Furthermore, this law diverts essential physician capacity away from the care of other patients.
                  </p><p> A state received a score of 3 if medication abortions need to be administered in the presence of a physician and a score of 0 if this is not required. Data for this restriction were acquired from the Guttmacher Institute’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion">data on Medication Abortion</a>.</p></li>
                  </ol>                 
                  <p>To calculate the composite COVID-19 Abortion Restriction Score, we first weighted the values for the variables assessing the restrictions limiting providers to delegate tasks and the requirement of a physician to be present for the administration of medication abortion by 0.5. We decided to weight these values as we believe that the other two variables have a more significant impact on a person's ability to access care during a pandemic, while the provider restrictions have more of an impact on facility capacity to provide services. We then added the weighted values of the restrictions for each state. Abortion services are more difficult to access in states with higher COVID-19 restriction scores than in states with lower scores. Though the restrictions used in the composite score were enacted to restrict abortion access before the pandemic, the effects of these restrictions are amplified in pandemic conditions.                  </p>

                  <p>The data for this map were collected using state government executive orders, press releases, and other news articles and analysis tracking whether abortion services are considered essential services during COVID-19. We classified each state into the following four categories according to the language used in their initial government order or official statement to the press in which essential and non-essential services were designated.</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li>Explicitly defines abortion services as non-essential</li>
                  <li>Does not explicitly define abortion services as essential or non-essential but leaves the decision up to the medical provider</li>
                  <li>Does not explicitly define abortion services as essential or non-essential</li>
                  <li>Explicitly defines abortion services as essential</li>  </ol>                
                    <p>This map demonstrates the necessity for explicit language indicating that abortion services are essential. Any ambiguity around this definition can be used by anti-abortion activists and government officials alike to restrict abortion access during the pandemic. We recorded each state’s designation in their initial government order, regardless of whether amendments to this designation were made. Initial designation highlights the level of priority given to reproductive health services and rights.                    </p>

                  <p>The data for this map were collected using news articles tracking the availability of abortion services across the US, abortion clinic websites, and abortion access fund and network pages. According to this data we classified each state into the following four categories:</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li>Abortion services (surgical and medication) are unavailable or banned</li>
                  <li>Surgical abortion is banned or extreme abortion restrictions exist</li>
                  <li>Abortion services are available but under threat or their availability is unclear (initially banned but was blocked and/or relevant history of anti-abortion actions)</li>
                  <li>Abortion services are available</li></ol>
                    <p>For some states, no reliable data was found regarding the availability of abortion services. We classified these states as unclear and in the same category as states where abortion services are available but under threat. A lack of clear messaging regarding abortion service availability greatly impacts a person’s ability to access these services. This map provides up-to-date information regarding the availability of abortion across the US and draws attention to states where, although abortion might currently be available, access to care is under threat.</p>

          <p>Abortion care is <strong>currently available</strong>, though under threat. The state has a COVID-19 abortion restriction score of 8 [high].</p>
          <p>Arkansas defines abortion as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/arkansas-abortion-coronavirus-court-ruling">non-essential service</a> during COVID-19. The only clinic providing procedural abortions in the state was ordered to stop providing services during the pandemic. A federal appeals court upheld this ban on most abortions on April 22. </p>
          <p>Despite plans to start reopening salons and other services in the state on May 6, the state issued an <a target="_blank" href=" https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/images/uploads/pdf/ResumeElectiveSurgeryDirectiveFINAL4.23.20.pdf">order</a>, stating that those seeking elective surgeries must have at least one negative COVID-19 NAAT test within 48 hours prior to the beginning of the procedure. On May 7, a federal judge <a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/ffff1417b388d59c41380629c554c9e2"> denied the request</a> from the only clinic able to provide abortions to block this testing rule. Due to the lack of test availability, the ruling effectively bans access to abortion in the state. As of May 27, the clinic has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/may/27/lr-clinic-pulls-suit-on-testing-2020052/">dropped the lawsuit</a>, but the scarce availability of tests makes access to surgical abortions in the state uncertain. </p>
          <p>Arkansas’ testing rule has been recently modified, now requiring a negative test within 72 hours of the procedure instead of within 48 hours, as previously required. Despite a federal judge’s May 7 denial of the clinic’s request that the abortion clinic be exused from this rule, the Little Rock Family Planning Services clinic is still <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/may/19/state-asks-to-dismiss-surgeries-challen-1/">requesting a permanent injunction</a>.</p>

          <p>Colorado defines abortion care as an <a target="_blank" href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/CODORA/bulletins/28256fe">essential service</a>, along with other procedures where “there is a risk of metastasis or progression of staging of a disease or condition if the surgery or procedure is not performed." Although the governor does not explicitly reference abortion care in his statement, the state’s attorney general provided a <a target="_blank" href="https://dems.ag/daga-dem-ags-statements-on-protecting-repro-health-care-during-covid-19/">statement</a> included in a press release from the Democratic Attorneys General Association assuring that access to abortion care would be protected during the pandemic.</p>
          <p>On June 8, a  Colorado group called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/08/colorado-abortion-ban-22-weeks/"> Due Date Too Late</a> gathered enough signatures in support of their initiative to make abortions past 22 weeks illegal. Colorado voters will vote on the initiative in November. The state is currently one of the only states without a gestational age limit.</p>
          <p> Since the initial <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">stay at home order</a>  expired on April 26, Governor Jared Polis has been lifting Colorado’s restrictions on businesses. The state has continued to open through the summer and early fall, thought the governor has reversed certain re-opening measures due to rising COVID-19 cases.

          <p>Abortion care is   <strong>currently available</strong>. The state has a COVID-19 abortion restriction score of 2 [medium]. </p>
          <p>Georgia’s <a target="_blank" href="https://gov.georgia.gov/executive-action/executive-orders/2020-executive-orders">Executive Order to Ensure a Safe and Healthy Georgia</a> makes no specific reference to reproductive health care clinics or abortion care. Their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.georgia.org/covid19bizguide">list of Critical Infrastructure</a> includes businesses, establishments, corporations, non-profit corporations, and organizations as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. This list of essential critical infrastructure also does not make specific reference to reproductive health care clinics or abortion care.  Despite this, Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health care clinics' websites indicate that they are continuing to provide services. On May 12, Gov. Brian Kemp made an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/kemp-excludes-abortion-providers-from-legal-liability-protections/jSGdQfLhenP9lP5JeF2lyL/">executive order</a> that limits legal liability for Georgia’s hospitals and medical orders. Kemp specifically blocked healthcare workers that provide abortions, however, from having these legal protections, claiming that “abortion providers are undeserving of enhanced liability protections because they are doing nothing to fight COVID-19 in Georgia.”
          </p>  
          <p>A federal judge may re-evaluate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-abortion-law-returns-court-monday/lPozgf0EIjyiZU7ST1V3oK/">Georgia’s restrictive abortion law</a> that was signed by Governer Brian Kemp last year within the next few weeks. The law, introduced as <a target="_blank" href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/481">House Bill 481</a>, would ban most abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected, or around 6 weeks post-conception. In October, the law was temporarily blocked by District Judge Steve C. Jones. The ACLU is urging Jones to make this a permanent injunction and is suing the state, claiming the law is unconstitutional.
          </p>
          <p>Georgia was one of the first states to begin re-opening, with Governor Brian Kemp <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-coronavirus-trnd/">lifting restrictions</a> for certain non-essential businesses on April 24.</p>

No legal challenges have been filed against the abortion ban. Despite the executive order and amicus brief, abortion clinic websites indicate that they are continuing to operate and provide services.

          <p>Governor Kim Reynolds confirmed on March 29 that abortion would be considered elective and thereby non-essential under Iowa’s <a target="_blank" href="https://rewire.news/article/2020/04/14/abortion-access-covid-states/#iowa">COVID-19 executive order</a>. In response to a lawsuit, Solicitor General Jeffrey Thompson <a target="_blank" href="https://muscatinejournal.com/news/state-and-regional/iowa/abortion-clinics-won-t-contest-covid-19-order/article_3acb7d22-c07c-5f95-a4d7-ebe690344e3e.html">clarified</a> that the ban would take into account medical factors and timing of the pregnancy. The state clarified on April 1 that Reynolds’s proclamation <a target="_blank" href ="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/01/coronavirus-in-iowa-essential-abortions-can-continue-covid-19/5103533002/">only suspends “non-essential” abortions</a>, but “essential” abortions can continue. The abortion may be considered “non-essential” if the surgery can be delayed without causing harm to the patient. According to their websites, reproductive health care facilities in Iowa are continuing to provide services. </p>
          <p>On June 13, Iowa lawakers passed an amendment that establishes a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kcci.com/article/iowa-lawmakers-pass-abortion-waiting-period/32860663">24-hour waiting period</a> before getting an abortion. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kcci.com/article/it-s-permanent-kentucky-family-gives-toddler-forever-home/32871661">Rep Jo Oldson</a>, “[the legislators have] kept this plan secret for weeks and released it on a Saturday night, so they didn't have to hear from Iowans.” On <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kcci.com/article/iowas-latest-abortion-law-temporarily-blocked-by-judge/33015807#">June 30</a>, the new law was temporarily blocked by a Johnson County judge.

Attorney General Daniel Cameron has <a target="_blank" href="https://rewire.news/article/2020/04/14/abortion-access-covid-states/#kentucky">pushed</a> for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to certify that abortion providers are in fact violating Governor Andy Beshear’s executive order banning elective procedures. If issued, this certification would shut down Kentucky’s only abortion clinic. Additionally, legislators in Kentucky voted to pass a bill that would allow the attorney general to ban abortion services in Kentucky during the pandemic, but Governor Andy Beshear <a target="_blank" href="https://msmagazine.com/2020/04/29/roundup-state-by-state-heres-where-abortion-restriction-battles-stand/">vetoed the bill</a>. </p>

Hope Medical Group for Women, one of Louisiana’s three abortion clinics, <a target="_blank" href="https://reproductiverights.org/press-room/louisianas-covid-19-ban-abortion-challenged-court">filed a lawsuit</a> against the state after Attorney General Landry targeted the clinic with an inspection, with the goal of shutting down services.

            <p>Abortion care is   <strong>currently available</strong>, though under threat. The state has a COVID-19 abortion restriction score of 5 [medium].</p>
            <p>Ohio defines abortion as a non-essential service during the COVID-19 pandemic. In early March, Attorney General Dave Yost ordered abortion clinics to cease <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/ohio-ag-tries-to-limit-abortion-care-citing-coronavirus.html">“nonessential and elective” abortion procedures</a>. Attorney General Yost also signed an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ag.state.la.us/Files/Amicus/2020%20Amicus/In%20re%20Greg%20Abbott%20(20-50264)/In%20re%20Greg%20Abbott%20(20-50264).pdf">amicus brief</a> supporting Texas’ efforts to ban abortion care during COVID-19. However, Judge Michael Barrett <a target="_blank" href="https://rewire.news/article/2020/04/14/abortion-access-covid-states/#ohio">granted an injunction</a> on April 23 that is keeping abortion available in Ohio, despite the continuous efforts to ban services in the state. On May 6, the Ohio House <a target="_blank" href="https://radio.wosu.org/post/anti-abortion-group-urges-ohio-senate-reject-limits-health-directors-powers#stream/0"> added an amendment</a> that would limit the power of the public health orders Governor Mike DeWine and his health advisor, Amy Acton. Anti-abortion activists are urging the House to reject this proposal, as it could make closing abortion clinics more difficult. The Governor vetoed this bill in July. 
            </p>
            <p>Ohio’s stay-at-home order expired on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html"> May 29</a>. In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dispatch.com/business/20200514/coronavirus-ohio-restaurants-bars-to-reopen-patios-who-will-come"> mid-May</a>, Governor Mike DeWine allowed the reopening of restaurants, retail stores, and other businesses. DeWine mandated the use of face masks for the whole state beginning on July 23, and is imposing other restrictions on a county-by-county basis. The state has continued to slowly reopen through the fall.             </p>

          <p>Texas has been at the forefront of the movement to restrict abortion during the pandemic. Governor Greg Abbott’s original March 22 <a target="_blank" href="https://lrl.texas.gov/scanned/govdocs/Greg%20Abbott/2020/GA-09.pdf">executive order</a> banned all non-essential medical procedures, classifying abortions as non-essential.

The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2020/04/federal-appeals-court-upholds-texas-abortion-ban-during-covid-19-pandemic/">upheld the ban</a>, though it <a target="_blank" href="https://rewire.news/article/2020/04/14/abortion-access-covid-states/#texas">expired on April 21</a>.</p>
          <p>Abortion is now available in Texas, as Texas’ <a target="_blank" href="https://rewire.news/article/2020/04/14/abortion-access-covid-states/#texas">new order</a> has exemptions for providers that do not use hospital beds or request personal protective equipment, and the state has agreed that abortion providers fall into this category.</p>
          <p>Governor Abbott began reopening certain businesses in the state on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-coronavirus-trnd/">May 8</a>. Due to a surge in cases in June, Governor Abbott <a target="_blank" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/06/26/texas-bars-restaurants-coronavirus-greg-abbott/">reversed part of his reopening plan</a>, reducing the capacity in restaurants to 50% and closing all bars.

          <p>Wyoming’s COVID-19 <a target="_blank" href="https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026">executive order</a> makes no specific reference to reproductive health care clinics or abortion care. Despite this, abortion clinic websites indicate that they continue to provide services, though it remains unclear the extent to which clinics are providing abortion services.           </p>
          <p>Wyoming did not have a statewide stay-at-home order in place. Restaurants, bars, and other businesses started reopening on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-coronavirus-trnd/">May 15</a>. As of mid-August, Governor Gordon allowed gatherings of up to 1000 people. In October, the governor reinstated certain business restrictions, though the state has continued to reopen.
