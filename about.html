        <h3>About</h3>
            <p>We are three recent college graduates interested in the politicization of abortion access and reproductive rights in the United States. This project came out of an attempt to answer a seemingly simple question: </p>
            <p class="text-center"><strong>“Can you get an abortion in my state during a pandemic?”</strong></p>
            <p>Despite hours of research, reading news articles and analysis, poring over executive orders and government press statements, the answer to this question remained complicated and obscure. Journalists, policymakers, and activists tracking this issue have come to the same conclusion. Some states have seized upon this moment to ban access to abortion, defining the procedure as “elective,” while others have moved to affirm protections for abortion. But in many states, it is nearly impossible to figure out how your access to care will be impacted. How is a woman in need of an abortion, and amidst all the other uncertainty and additional burden brought about by COVID-19, supposed to determine this?</p>
            <p>We have produced three maps that together indicate whether abortion services were initially defined as essential or non-essential services, whether abortion services are now available, and how pre-existing abortion restrictions have affected access. These maps are intended to provide some needed clarity around abortion availability and access during the COVID-19 pandemic, and hold states accountable.</p>
            <p>These three maps are only an initial assessment of the impacts of COVID-19 on abortion availability and access. There are innumerable other consequences of COVID-19 on abortion and reproductive health care access that are experienced inequitably accross communties in the U.S. Researchers before us have identified how gender identity, economic status, race, and immigration status all affect access to reproductive health. Reproductive healthcare access is inequitable in non-pandemic conditions, though the pandemic has exacerbated health inequities.  Next iterations of this site will ideally address these critical factors and we welcome any feedback as to how to best address the many factors affecting equitable access. </p>
            <p>We hope that you find this website useful. If you have any questions, comments, or ideas, please let us know at [email address]. We welcome all feedback as we recognize the importance of unity in standing up for our reproductive health care rights.</p>
            <p class="text-center">Thank you!</p>
