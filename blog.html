                <p>To understand how the pandemic has impacted individual clinics, it is critical to understand how it has shifted patient population. We assessed this landscape by asking clinic staff about these demographic shifts, including changes in the distance people were traveling to receive reproductive healthcare.</p>
                <p>Throughout the pandemic, journalists told stories of patients making <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/02/826369859/in-texas-oklahoma-women-turned-away-because-of-coronavirus-abortion-bans">hours long journeys out of state</a> to access abortions when states like Texas banned the procedure, forcing providers to refer patients to Kansas and New Mexico. Just last week, a <a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2774731">research article</a>  published in <i>The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</i> documented an increase in travel by people seeking abortion services outside of Texas during the month of April (see our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ6LX7YAVRg/">Instagram post</a> on this article here). Traveling long distances for care places an unnecessary burden and exacerbates existing barriers for folks, especially those who do not have access to transportation or are unable to afford accommodations or childcare during travel. We wondered how abortion clinics had experienced these shifts in patient demographics and what they saw as the driving force behind these changes.
                </p>
                <p>All of the clinics we interviewed had either noticed changes in patient geographic origin or identified reasons for a lack of change during the pandemic. One Alabama clinic noted that patients were traveling further distances to seek care; while their usual patient demographic was from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Florida, patients had started coming from Texas too, driving upwards of ten hours to seek care. At the same time, some clinics noted they had not seen major shifts in patients’ geographic origin. The clinics we interviewed were all in states or located near states that are hostile to abortion access, and particularly so during the pandemic. As a result, clinics noted that they have always seen patients from all over the region travel for care—even before the pandemic. Ultimately, the pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing access concerns. 
                </p>
                <p>One clinic administrator noted that they were already in one of the “most restrictive states anyway,” stating:</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">“We're almost used to it... it's just more difficult for the patients to try to navigate getting here and finding some place to stay and all of those things that go along with it especially in the midst of a pandemic."</p>
                  </blockquote>


                <p>Given that so many sources documented increased out-of-state for abortion care during the pandemic, we expected more homogeneity in these responses about patient geographic origin. Instead, the five clinics we interviewed offered varied answers and reflections. Just as the populations they serve vary widely, each clinic has distinctive experiences and distinctive needs. Now more than ever these clinics—and especially independent clinics—need support.</p>
                <p>Barriers in geographic access to abortion services have always existed and are only amplified by pandemic restrictions and concerns about contracting COVID-19 during travel. Local abortion funds help patients and clinics overcome this barrier by helping patients fund and arrange their travel. Our action item for this blog post is to <strong>look up your local abortion fund using this <a target="_blank" href="https://abortionfunds.org/need-abortion/#funds-list">map</a>, read about their work, and make a donation today!    </strong>

                    <p>The pandemic sweeping across America isn’t just a health issue for people who contract COVID-19. It’s also hurting people who need abortions. In May we launched this site, Access Atlas: a set of maps that track abortion availability and access during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this research allowed us to expose the uneven impacts of state-level responses to the COVID-19 crisis on abortion access, our analysis of their implications lacked local narrative. </p>
                    <p>Today we’re launching a new blog series to highlight some of our findings from a months long research project on the effects of the pandemic on individual abortion clinics. Over the past few months, we have called clinics in the 11 states that classified abortion as non-essential in initial government orders. We conducted five informal interviews with clinics in Alabama, Tennessee, Iowa, and Nebraska, and collected both quantitative and qualitative data on over ten clinic level variables. This blog series will look at the findings from these interviews, exploring areas of commonality and difference in clinic experiences. Our goal is to highlight the unique experiences that clinics and their clients have had to navigate and overcome throughout the COVID-19 crisis and the need to support abortion providers now more than ever. </p>
                    <p>Over the next few months, we will be posting the findings from our interviews in a series of bi-weekly blog posts. We will look at issues ranging from changes in clinic staff to financial strain on clinics to confusion around COVID-19 executive orders. Stay tuned for our findings in the next posts! </p>
